## PHP

So, you fancy programming PHP do ya? Well, here are some tips specifically for you.

### PHP Runtimes

Microsoft Azure Web Sites has a selection of default installed PHP Runtimes, however, the option is still available to bring your own runtime if a specific version of PHP is required.

{% include html-php-runtimes.md %}

#### Bring your own Runtime

{% include html-alert-php-byo-runtime.md %}

{% include html-alert-php-byo-phpini.md %}

In order to do this there are a few steps involved:

1. Download the <abbr title="Non Thread Safe">NTS</abbr> PHP runtime
	* From  [PHP for Windows downloads](http://windows.php.net/downloads) page and upload to ```/site/wwwroot/bin/php``` via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>.
	* Using [KuduExec](#kuduexec) or [KuduExec (Web)](#kuduexec-web)

### Default PHP Extensions

{% include html-alert-enable-php-extensions.md %}

### Enabling PHP Extensions

Extensions can be enabled by adding **App Settings** to your Web Site with the following reserved app setting keys.

{% include html-php-appsettings.md %}

### Enabling XDebug

To enable the use of this `ini` file, create an `ini` folder within `d:\home\site\` and drop the following `xdebug.ini` file inside the folder. In the **App Settings** section of the portal, add a new App Setting `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` with the value of `d:\home\site\ini`. You must restart the App Service for these chances to take effect.
